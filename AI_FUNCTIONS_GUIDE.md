# Simple Decision AI - Function Guide

## üéØ 8 Function Options in the Batch File (ai.bat)

### 1. Quick Decision
**Function**: Input a single question to immediately get an AI's Yes/No judgment.
**Use Cases**:
- Quickly verify facts: "Is water wet?"
- Check logic: "If A > B and B > C, then A > C"
- Common-sense judgment: "Do humans need oxygen?"

**Example**:
```
Input: "Is the sky blue?"
Output: Decision: [Yes/No] + Confidence + Reasoning
```

### 2. Interactive Mode
**Function**: Continuous conversation mode for asking multiple questions in a row.
**Use Cases**:
- Testing multiple questions sequentially
- Exploring the AI's judgment logic
- Long-running sessions

**Features**:
- Type `help` to see commands
- Type `stats` to view statistics
- Type `quit` to exit
- Supports real-time threshold adjustment

### 3. Batch Process
**Function**: Process multiple questions from a file and get all results at once.
**Input Format**: A JSON file containing a list of questions.
```json
[
  "Question 1",
  "Question 2",
  "Question 3"
]
```

**Use Cases**:
- Large-scale data testing
- Model performance evaluation
- Automated testing

**Output**: Full results for each question + a statistical summary.

### 4. View Stats
**Function**: Displays statistical information about the AI's decisions.
**Information Included**:
- Total number of decisions
- Yes/No decision ratio
- High/low confidence decision ratio
- Model information (name, device, parameters, etc.)

**Purpose**: To understand the AI's decision patterns and performance.

### 5. View History
**Function**: Displays recent decision records.
**Content Displayed**:
- The last 10 decision records
- Each record includes: question, answer, confidence, timestamp
- Arranged in reverse chronological order

**Purpose**: To review past decisions and identify patterns.

### 6. Show Demo
**Function**: Runs a full system demonstration.
**Demo Content**:
- Project overview and architecture
- Examples of supported judgment types
- Expected output format
- Project structure explanation
- Usage guide

**Purpose**: For new users to understand the system's capabilities.

### 7. Set Threshold
**Function**: Adjust the confidence threshold for AI decisions.
**Threshold Range**: 0.0 - 1.0
**Impact**:
- High threshold (0.8+): Only accepts high-confidence decisions
- Low threshold (0.5-): Accepts more uncertain decisions
- Default: 0.5

**Usage Suggestions**:
- For important decisions: use a high threshold (0.8)
- For exploratory testing: use a low threshold (0.3)

### 8. Debug Mode üÜï
**Function**: A dedicated mode for testing and correcting AI responses.
**Debugging Flow**:
1. Input a test question
2. View the AI's response
3. Input the correct answer
4. Provide a reason for the correction
5. The feedback is recorded for improvement

**Preset Test Cases**:
- "Is the sky blue?" ‚Üí Should be Yes
- "2 + 2 = 5" ‚Üí Should be No
- "Can you understand English?" ‚Üí Should be Yes
- "Cats can fly naturally" ‚Üí Should be No

**Purpose**:
- To identify model issues
- To collect training feedback
- To verify the effectiveness of fixes

## üöÄ Quick Usage Guide

### Command-Line Shortcuts
```bash
ai "question"                # Quick decision
ai -i                        # Interactive mode  
ai -demo                     # View demo
ai -stats                    # View stats
ai -history                  # View history
ai -batch questions.json     # Batch process
ai -threshold 0.8            # Set threshold
```

### Debugging Workflow
1. Run `ai.bat`
2. Select `8` (Debug Mode)
3. Test question: "Is the sky blue?"
4. Check the AI's answer (it might be an incorrect "No")
5. Input the correct answer: "Yes"
6. Provide a reason: "The sky appears blue due to light scattering"
7. The feedback is recorded for model improvement

## üéØ Current Status Explanation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The current AI uses an untrained BERT model, so:
- Answers may not be accurate
- Confidence is generally low (50-70%)
- There is a bias (tends to answer "No")

**üìà Improvement Suggestions**:
1. Use debug mode to collect error cases
2. Prepare a training dataset
3. Fine-tune the BERT model
4. Re-test and validate

This is why debug mode is necessary - to help us find and correct these issues!
