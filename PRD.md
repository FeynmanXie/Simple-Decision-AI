# Simple Decision AI System - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Name
Simple Decision AI

### 1.2 Project Goal
To create an AI system capable of simple reasoning and judgment, specifically for making "Yes" or "No" decisions on various statements or questions. The system should have a degree of flexibility and not rely solely on keyword matching.

### 1.3 Core Functionality
- Receive English statements or questions as input
- Perform simple logical reasoning and judgment
- Output a "Yes" or "No" result
- Possess some level of contextual understanding

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- **Main Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Machine Learning Framework**: Transformers (Hugging Face)
- **Pre-trained Model**: BERT or a similar language understanding model
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Configuration Management**: YAML
- **Logging System**: logging
- **Testing Framework**: pytest

### 2.2 System Architecture

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Core Functional Requirements
1.  **Text Understanding**: Ability to understand the semantics of English statements.
2.  **Logical Reasoning**: Perform simple reasoning based on common sense and logic.
3.  **Binary Judgment**: Output a clear "Yes" or "No" result.
4.  **Confidence Score**: Provide a confidence score for the judgment.

### 3.2 Input/Output Specifications
- **Input**: English text string (max length 512 characters).
- **Output**: JSON format.
  ```json
  {
    "decision": "Yes/No",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "A brief explanation of the reasoning process"
  }
  ```

### 3.3 Judgment Types
The system should be able to handle the following types of judgments:
- Factual judgment ("The sky is blue")
- Logical judgment ("If A > B and B > C, then A > C")
- Common-sense judgment ("People need water to survive")
- Mathematical judgment ("2 + 2 = 4")

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
